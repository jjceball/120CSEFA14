Overall project implementation:
Preface for the README is that as a group we began to implement Project 3 once Project 2 was turned in. Khoa ended up dropping the class, and after part 1 of the project (which was implemented mainly by Ian and Ricardo) due to circumstances, our group decided to split up. The rest is my attempt at implementing the rest of the project. I spent a good amount of time first cleaning up the project 2 and its implementation. From there, I went about implementing part 2.  Part 3 is severely lacking, as I don’t have many tests for the project. Part 4 was implemented in stats. Overall, this project is lacking a lot in part 2 and 3. 

Part 1: This part was mainly implemented by the previous team members. 

Part 2: Missing implementation. I made the backingstore class but its mainly the skeleton with no implementation. I also created some new methods in addrspace to complete the demand paging with page replacement but I didn’t implement them.  

Part 3: I know that there is a lack of testing, as I was mainly concerned with getting some code for part 1 and 2. 

Part 4: This part was implemented in stats.h and stats.cc. 

Distribution of work:
Part 1 implemented by previous team members and the rest was implemented by me. I am including the previous members information because some of the code is the same.
